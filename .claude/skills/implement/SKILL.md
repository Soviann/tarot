# Implement GitHub Issue

**IMPORTANT:** When this skill loads, create a task (TaskCreate) for EACH step below and complete them in order. Mark each task `in_progress` before starting it and `completed` when done. No step may be skipped silently.

1. Read the GitHub issue linked or pick the highest-priority Todo from the project board.
2. Create a feature branch from main: `git checkout -b feature/<short-name>` and push it on the remote.
3. Move the GitHub issue on the project board to In Progress.
4. Follow TDD: write failing tests → implement → all tests pass → lint clean.
5. Update CHANGELOG.md with the change.
6. Update any relevant docs.
7. Commit, push, create a PR, request review, fix any review comments.
8. Squash merge the PR.
9. Update your memory, delete local feature branch.
