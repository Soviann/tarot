# Implement GitHub Issue

1. Read the GitHub issue linked or pick the highest-priority Todo from the project board.
2. Create a feature branch from main: `git checkout -b feature/<short-name>`
3. Follow TDD: write failing tests → implement → all tests pass → lint clean.
4. Update CHANGELOG.md with the change.
5. Update any relevant docs.
6. Create a PR, request review, fix any review comments.
7. Squash merge the PR.
8. Update project board to Done, update your memory, delete local feature branch.
